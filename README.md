# TicTacToe
Midterm exam for a tic-tac-toe game. Code is written in C++. Requirements for the code are written within this README and commented within the code itself.

Purpose of Program:
The purpose of this program is to generate a tic tac toe game. 2 players will play in this game.
The turn cycles back and forth until somebody wins. Each turn is checked by my personal function
called 'checkForWinner', where it traverses the 2D array looking for any potential winning combination.
If one is detected, the game stops and a winner is announced.

At the end of the game, the system will ask if the players would like to play again. If 'y' or 'Y' is
typed, then another game will start. If 'n' or 'N' is typed, the system will thank the players and exit.
If any other input is put into the system at that time, the games will end.
